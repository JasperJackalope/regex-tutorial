URLs are a common data type used in many applications, and regex can be a powerful tool for validating and parsing them. In this article, we will look at how to use regex to match URLs that begin with either "http", "https", or "ftp" protocols

## Summary

We will examine the individual components of the regex pattern, such as anchors, quantifiers, and character classes, and discuss how they work together to match URLs. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of how to use regex to match URLs in your own applications.

^(https?|ftp):\/\/[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*$
Breaking down this pattern:

^ - matches the beginning of the string
(https?|ftp) - matches either "http", "https", or "ftp" protocols
:\/\/ - matches the characters "://"
[^\s/$.?#] - matches any character that is not a whitespace, forward slash, question mark, period, or hash character
. - matches a single period
[^\s]* - matches any number of characters that are not whitespace
This pattern will match URLs in the following format:

Copy code
http://example.com
https://www.example.com/path
ftp://example.com/file.zip
Note that this pattern is not a complete solution for URL validation, as there are many possible URL formats and variations. However, it can be a useful starting point for many applications.
